# 1. Application Onboarding – Tools & Access Prerequisites

## 1.1 Purpose and Scope

Before a team can onboard an application to the Argo platform and request WAF design/implementation support, engineers must have access to a common set of tools (GitLab, Jenkins, Artifactory, AWS, observability, security tooling, etc.).

This section describes:

- Required **training**  
- How to request **access** to each tool via ServiceNow or other channels  
- Which tools are **mandatory vs. optional** for application onboarding

This documentation is **internal** and targeted at:  
- Application teams deploying to Argo  
- MDT Argo / Cap teams  
- Support teams assisting with onboarding

---

## 1.2 High-Level Onboarding Checklist

Before engaging with MDT Argo for design sessions or WAF integration, application engineers should:

1. Complete mandatory **GitLab training**.
2. Request **CI/CD platform access** (GitLab, Jenkins, Artifactory).
3. Request access to **security tooling** (Contrast, CloudGuard).
4. Request access to **observability tooling** (Grafana, monitoring roles).
5. Request access to **documentation repositories** (D2 MRCS).
6. Request **CyberArk** access for privileged credentials.
7. Request **AWS account access** for the relevant Argo accounts.
8. (Optional but recommended) Install **Docker Desktop** for local testing.
9. Join the **Argo Platform** and **Kubernetes upgrade** communities.
