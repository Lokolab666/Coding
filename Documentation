Below is the revised and expanded table for Management-Level Stakeholders, now explicitly incorporating the named roles you provided.
Where a named individual is not formally assigned to a management role, the table clearly states “TBD / As Assigned” to keep it audit-safe and realistic.

Governance and Audit Note

Named individuals are included only where roles are operationally assigned.

“TBD / As Assigned” ensures compliance with governance, audits, and role rotation policies.

This table is suitable for:

Operational Model documentation

SLA and OLA definitions

ServiceNow role alignment

Governance and audit reviews




---

If you want, next I can:

Produce long-form role descriptions for each named role (1–2 pages total)

Build a RACI matrix tied to ServiceNow assignment groups

Align this table visually with the Medtronic Governance Model diagram


Just say the word.












# 1. Application Onboarding – Tools & Access Prerequisites

## 1.1 Purpose and Scope

Before a team can onboard an application to the Argo platform and request WAF design/implementation support, engineers must have access to a common set of tools (GitLab, Jenkins, Artifactory, AWS, observability, security tooling, etc.).

This section describes:

- Required **training**  
- How to request **access** to each tool via ServiceNow or other channels  
- Which tools are **mandatory vs. optional** for application onboarding

This documentation is **internal** and targeted at:  
- Application teams deploying to Argo  
- MDT Argo / Cap teams  
- Support teams assisting with onboarding

---

## 1.2 High-Level Onboarding Checklist

Before engaging with MDT Argo for design sessions or WAF integration, application engineers should:

1. Complete mandatory **GitLab training**.
2. Request **CI/CD platform access** (GitLab, Jenkins, Artifactory).
3. Request access to **security tooling** (Contrast, CloudGuard).
4. Request access to **observability tooling** (Grafana, monitoring roles).
5. Request access to **documentation repositories** (D2 MRCS).
6. Request **CyberArk** access for privileged credentials.
7. Request **AWS account access** for the relevant Argo accounts.
8. (Optional but recommended) Install **Docker Desktop** for local testing.
9. Join the **Argo Platform** and **Kubernetes upgrade** communities.

Great — below are formal, detailed descriptions for the Operational Cycles (Daily / Weekly / Monthly).
Each section includes: purpose, owners, attendees, cadence, agenda, expected outputs/artifacts, links to SLAs/KPIs, and example checklist items you can copy into runbooks or ServiceNow knowledge articles.


---

6. Operational Cycles — Formal Descriptions

These operational cycles structure recurring operational activity to ensure stability, SLA compliance, knowledge hygiene, and continuous improvement for the Atlas Kubernetes platform and associated services.


---

6.1 Daily Operations — “Shift-to-Shift” (Cadence: daily / each shift)

Purpose
Daily operations focus on rapid detection of degradation, maintaining service availability, ensuring timely handovers, and tracking SLA conformance. This is the tactical heartbeat of operations: catch problems early, ensure continuity across shifts, and avoid SLA breaches.

Owner
Support Manager / Operations Manager (operational responsibility)
Day-to-day facilitation: L1 Lead (on-shift), L2 lead (on-call as needed).

Attendees

L1 shift lead (required)

Assigned L2 on-call (as needed)

Cadence & Duration

Frequency: Daily, at each shift start (or a single daily handover meeting if single-shift)

Duration: 15–30 minutes (concise)


Standard Agenda

1. Quick status: items open from prior shift (top 3)


2. Dashboard review: active alerts, trending spikes, cluster health (nodes, control-plane, critical namespaces)


3. SLA tracker: incidents approaching Response/Resolution SLAs — assign owners for immediate action


4. High-severity incidents: brief review and explicit next steps (if any)


5. Workload / planned maintenance alerts for the day (scheduling conflicts)

Top 5 root causes and remediation status

Roadmap items and owner commitments

Executive summary: risks and recommended resource or process shifts




---

6.4 Cross-Cycle Integration & Handoff Rules

Purpose
Ensure that outputs from one cadence feed into the next: daily operational issues that require follow-up become weekly actions; weekly trend items that require strategic intervention become monthly governance decisions.

Rules

Any item escalated from Daily that requires >72 hours to resolve must be listed on the next Weekly agenda with an owner and target remedial plan.

Weekly action items with strategic impact or budget/resource requests must be escalated to the Monthly governance agenda with required documentation.

RCA findings (for P1/P2) generated during Post-Incident Review must be included in the next Monthly meeting and associated KB updates scheduled.


Artifact Location & Ownership

Shift Handover Documents: stored in the Operations shared folder and linked in ServiceNow incidents. Owner: L1 Lead.

Weekly reports and KB update lists: stored in KB repository with owners assigned. Owner: L2 Lead.

Monthly performance decks and decision logs: stored in Governance repository. Owner: Program Manager / Support Manager.



---

6.5 Suggested Tools & Dashboards

ServiceNow: incident and action tracking, RCA linkage, change and emergency change records.

Monitoring Dashboards (Grafana / Datadog / Prometheus): cluster health, alerting, MTTR/MTTA views.

Shared Documentation (Confluence / SharePoint / KB system): SOPs, playbooks, meeting minutes, RCA docs.

Communication Tools: Teams/Slack for war-room channels and daily handover chat logs.

Reporting: Scheduled PDF exports of dashboards for Weekly and Monthly attachments.



---

If you want, I can:

Produce copy-paste meeting agendas (Daily/Weekly/Monthly) in markdown or ServiceNow Task templates

Generate PowerPoint-ready slides for the Monthly Report (layout + charts placeholders)

Create ServiceNow workflow templates that create the weekly and monthly meeting tasks automatically from incidents approaching SLA
