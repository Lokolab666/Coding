## Ticket Resolution Documentation – Authoring Guidelines

### Purpose

This document defines the mandatory structure and content requirements for creating ticket resolution documentation. The objective is to ensure clarity, consistency, traceability, and to avoid duplication of existing solutions.

---

### Important Considerations

Before creating a new document, **verify whether a resolution already exists** for the same issue or request.
If an existing document covers the resolution, **do not duplicate the information**. Instead, reference the existing documentation where applicable.

---

### Document Title

The title **must follow the structure below**:

```
{tool-or-application} – {brief-description} – {key-technical-keywords}
```

The title should be concise, descriptive, and clearly indicate the scope of the resolution.

---

### Document Body Structure

The body of the document must include the following sections, in the order listed below.

#### 1. Customer Request Description

Provide a clear and concise description of the customer’s request.
This section should answer:

* What was requested?
* What problem or need was identified?
* Any relevant context that led to the request.

Avoid assumptions and focus strictly on the information provided by the customer.

---

#### 2. Resolution Details (Step-by-Step)

Describe the resolution process in a logical, step-by-step manner.
Each step should be explicit enough to allow another engineer to reproduce the solution.

Where applicable, include:

* Hyperlinks to repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
* References to official documentation
* External articles, videos, or recordings that support the resolution

All links must be relevant, accessible, and clearly associated with the step they support.

---

#### 3. Visual Evidence (Optional but Recommended)

If available, include screenshots that illustrate key steps of the resolution process, such as:

* Configuration changes
* Command execution results
* Application behavior before and after the fix

Ensure that screenshots are clear, properly cropped, and do not expose sensitive information.

---

#### 4. Request or Ticket Reference

At the end of the document, include the corresponding request or ticket number to ensure traceability.

**Example:**

```
Request ID: INC-123456
```

---

### Reference Example

Refer to the provided example page as a baseline for formatting, tone, and level of detail expected in the documentation.

---

This structure must be followed for all ticket resolution documents to ensure consistency, quality, and long-term maintainability of support knowledge.
